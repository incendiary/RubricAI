# RubricAI

A vulnerability prioritisation MCP server. Engineers answer structured questions about a CVE finding; RubricAI fetches public intel (CISA KEV, EPSS, NVD, PoC signals), applies a deterministic CHML scoring policy, and produces a standardised report card (markdown + JSON) for central review.

---

## Background

Vulnerability triage at scale is broken. Teams receive hundreds of CVE notifications per month; CVSS scores are context-free (a CVSS 9.8 in an air-gapped dev tool is not the same risk as a CVSS 7.0 in an internet-facing API); and remediation SLAs vary by team, tool, and mood. The result is inconsistent prioritisation, audit friction, and genuine risk buried under noise.

RubricAI addresses this with two components:

**1. A deterministic scoring engine (this repo)**
A Python MCP server that fetches live public intel signals — CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, FIRST EPSS exploitation probability scores, NVD CVSS data, and PoC availability heuristics — and runs them through a fixed rule set called CHML (Critical / High / Medium / Low). The rules are code, not prompts: given the same inputs, the same lane is always assigned. This makes decisions auditable, reproducible, and easy to review centrally.

**2. A structured interview workflow**
A platform-agnostic Markdown document (`prompts/workflow.md`) that defines a 10-section interview an AI client conducts with engineers. The interview collects the contextual signals that public databases cannot: Is this component internet-exposed? Are there compensating controls? What data is at risk? The workflow is rendered into platform-specific system prompts via a Jinja2 template renderer for Claude, generic MCP clients, and Gemini.

Together they replace ad-hoc severity gut-feel with a consistent, evidence-backed assessment that both engineers and security teams can reason about.

## How it works

```
Engineer interview  →  intel_lookup  →  score_evaluate  →  report_generate
(structured Q&A)      (KEV/EPSS/NVD)   (CHML policy)      (report card to disk)
```

The AI client runs the interview (collecting finding context), then calls the MCP tools in sequence. Scoring happens server-side in pure Python — the AI is the interface, not the judge.

**CHML lanes:**

| Lane | Trigger | Default target |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Critical | KEV listed + internet-exposed + high utility (RCE/auth bypass/priv-esc/data access) | 72 hours |
| High | Internet-exposed + EPSS ≥ 0.5 or PoC available + high utility | 7 days |
| Medium | Constrained/internal reachability, lower impact, or partial mitigations | Patch train |
| Low | Local-only + low utility, or strong causal mitigations blocking the exploit path | Patch train |

All four lane targets are configurable — see [Environment variables](#environment-variables).

**Guardrails:**
- External intel (KEV, high EPSS, PoC) can escalate urgency but cannot downgrade a finding.
- Mitigations must be exploit-relevant to shift a lane — "EDR deployed" does not mitigate an IDOR.
- Medium → Low requires a mitigation with a `causal_claim` of type `waf_rule`, `acl_segmentation`, `disable_feature`, `vendor_workaround`, or `virtual_patching`.

## Setup

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/incendiary/RubricAI/releases/latest) or clone a specific tag:

```bash
# Latest release (recommended)
git clone --branch v0.4.0 --depth 1 git@github.com:incendiary/RubricAI.git
cd RubricAI

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install

cp .env.example .env
```

To track development (not recommended for production use):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:incendiary/RubricAI.git
cd RubricAI
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

---

## Running

### Local — Claude Desktop (stdio transport)

Generate a system prompt and start the server:

```bash
# Generate the Claude-specific system prompt
python scripts/render_prompt.py --target claude
# → prompts/out/claude_system_prompt.md

# Start the MCP server
python -m src.main
```

Register the server in `claude_desktop_config.json` using the merge script (safe to run on an existing config — it adds only the `rubricai` key and leaves everything else intact):

```bash
# Preview what will change
python scripts/install_claude_config.py

# Apply
python scripts/install_claude_config.py --write
```

The script auto-detects the config path on macOS, Windows, and Linux. To override:

```bash
python scripts/install_claude_config.py --config ~/my-config.json --write
```

Restart Claude Desktop after writing. Open a new conversation, paste the contents of `prompts/out/claude_system_prompt.md` as the system prompt, and tell Claude you have a CVE to assess.

### Team deployment — Docker (SSE transport)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set NVD_API_KEY if you have one

docker compose up --build
```

Point your MCP client at `http://localhost:8000/sse`. Reports are persisted to `./reports/` on the host.

### Other MCP clients (generic / Gemini)

```bash
python scripts/render_prompt.py --target generic   # → prompts/out/generic_system_prompt.md
python scripts/render_prompt.py --target gemini    # → prompts/out/gemini_system_prompt.md
```

Paste the output into your client's system prompt field.

## Tool call flow

An AI client conducts a session like this:

```
0. env_read()
   → load existing environment state (components, network, standing mitigations)
   → pre-populate interview answers; skip questions already answered

1. Interview engineer — collect finding fields:
     component, version, entry_point, reachability, attacker_utility,
     mitigations, data_impact, environment
   → ask for supporting evidence for any mitigation or reachability claim

2. intel_lookup(cves=["CVE-XXXX-YYYY"])
   → returns KEV status, EPSS score, CVSS, PoC availability

3. score_evaluate(finding=..., intel=...)
   → returns lane (critical/high/medium/low), target, rationale, evidence gaps

4. report_generate(finding=..., intel=..., assessment=..., evidence=[...])
   → persists markdown + JSON report cards to RUBRICAI_REPORT_DIR
   → evidence items stored in JSON; Evidence section rendered in markdown

5. env_write(state=...)
   → save updated environment state with session_log entry
```

Report files are written as `{finding_id}_{timestamp}.md` and `.json` under `RUBRICAI_REPORT_DIR` (default `./reports/`).

---

## Environment state

RubricAI maintains a versioned environment state file so the AI accumulates context across sessions rather than starting cold each time.

### Bootstrap

```bash
cp environment/initial_state_template.json environment/state_v001.json
# Edit state_v001.json: fill in your components, network topology, standing mitigations
```

The AI will read this at the start of the next session and use it to skip questions it can already answer.

### Versioning

Every `env_write` call increments the version counter and writes a new `state_vNNN.json` — existing files are never overwritten. `state_latest.json` is always a copy of the most recent version.

```
environment/
  initial_state_template.json   ← checked in, copy to bootstrap
  state_v001.json               ← your initial description
  state_v002.json               ← updated after first session
  state_latest.json             ← always the most recent
```

Set `RUBRICAI_ENV_DIR` to change the directory.

### State file fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `components` | Known components: name, version, type, environment, hosting |
| `network` | Topology: which services are internet-exposed, internal, etc. |
| `standing_mitigations` | Controls that apply across all findings (WAF, ACL, etc.) |
| `context_notes` | Free-form environment summary |
| `session_log` | Append-only history of what each session assessed and learned |

### Example: three-tier web application

The environment below illustrates how the state file captures topology that affects scoring. Notice that `UserDB` (PII) and `AnalyticsDB` (non-sensitive) sit in the same network tier, but the AI uses `context_notes` and component notes to distinguish risk — a CVE in `PaymentAPI` touching `UserDB` scores differently from the same CVE in `ReportingService` touching `AnalyticsDB`.

  "session_log": []
}
```

The key contrast: a finding in `PaymentAPI` with `data_access` utility scores higher because `context_notes` flags it as the path to PII. A finding in `ReportingService` with the same CVE scores lower — `AnalyticsDB` holds no sensitive data and the service is further from the internet entry point.

## Evidence

When an engineer claims a mitigation is in place (e.g. "we have a firewall blocking that port"), the AI can ask for supporting evidence and record it in the report.

**How it works:** The AI asks the engineer to paste the relevant policy, config, or describe a screenshot. It assesses whether the content is consistent with the claim and sets `verified: true/false`. Evidence is stored in the report JSON and rendered in the markdown report under an **Evidence** section.

**What to provide:**
- Firewall/ACL policy output (`iptables -L`, security group rules, NSG config)
- WAF rule excerpts
- Network config showing segmentation
- Log extracts confirming blocked traffic
- Screenshot descriptions

Evidence type values: `firewall_policy`, `network_config`, `acl_rule`, `waf_config`, `screenshot_description`, `log_extract`, `other`.
